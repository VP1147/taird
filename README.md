## TAIRD
### Tiny Arduino InfraRed Decoder
A simple Arduino infrared interface made from scratch. 
The code digitalizes the analog input (port A0) coming from the detector, being capable of self-calibrating according to the incidence of infrared light in the environment. The 0-1 threshold is manually ajusted with a potenciometer (port A1).

This project is pretend for me to learn basic electronics concepts.
